#We want to loop over the list in a way that captures each name and its position in the list.
#Capture the name in the variable name, and the index in the variable idx.
#Then print the index, a space, and the name.
#If the number of names in the list reaches 100, stop the loop.
# Modify the comments in the code below with statements that will complete the code.
